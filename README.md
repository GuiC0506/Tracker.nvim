Tracker is currently in development ‚ö†Ô∏è,  so it still misses some important user-customization features. You can already try it, but don't use it seriously just yet.

## What is Tracker?

`tracker.nvim` is a feature-rich plugin for Neovim aimed at providing comprehensive tracking and analysis of developer activities within Neovim.
- **Detailed Tracking**: Watches a variety of events. Check [Tracker events]()
- **Data Analysis**: Uses the data collected via the events to make valuable analysis of your perfomance
- **Flexible Customization**: Customize settings to fit your workflow and individual preferences.
